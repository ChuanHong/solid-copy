# solid: A Divide-and-Conquer Method for Sparse Risk Prediction and Evaluation

[![CRAN](https://www.r-pkg.org/badges/version/solid)](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=solid)

## Overview

Divide-and-conquer (DAC) is a commonly used strategy to overcome the challenges of extraordinarily large data, by first breaking the dataset into series of data blocks, then combining results from individual data blocks to obtain a final estimation. We propose a screening and one-step linearization infused DAC (SOLID) algorithm to fit sparse logistic regression to massive datasets, by integrating the DAC strategy with a screening step and sequences of linearization. 

The package `solid` consists 1) a screening and one-step linearization infused DAC (SOLID) algorithm to fit sparse logistic regression to massive datasets, and 2) a modified cross-validation (MCV) that utilizes the side products of the SOLID hence substantially reduce the computational burden.

## Installation

Install development version from GitHub:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
# install.packages("remotes")
