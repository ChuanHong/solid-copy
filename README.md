# solid: A Divide-and-Conquer Method for Sparse Risk Prediction and Evaluation

## Overview

The package `solid` consists 1) a screening and one-step linearization
infused DAC (SOLID) algorithm to fit sparse logistic regression to
massive datasets, and 2) a modified cross-validation (MCV) that utilizes
the side products of the SOLID hence substantially reduce the
computational burden.

## Installation

Install development version from GitHub:

``` r
# install.packages("remotes")
