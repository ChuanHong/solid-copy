# A Divide-and-Conquer Method for Sparse Risk Prediction and Evaluation

The package `solid` consists 1) a screening and one-step linearization infused DAC (SOLID) algorithm to fit sparse logistic regression to massive datasets, and 2) a modified cross-validation (MCV) that utilizes the side products of the SOLID hence substantially reduce the computational burden.

## Installation

Install development version from GitHub:
 
```r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("celehs/solid")
```
