Imports: MASS, glmpath, glmnet, stats
Description: The package consists 1) a screening and one-step linearization infused DAC (SOLID) algorithm to fit sparse logistic regression to massive datasets, and 2) a modified cross-validation (MCV) that utilizes the side products of the SOLID hence substantially reduce the computational burden.
